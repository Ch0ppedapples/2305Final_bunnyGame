## Description
My project will be a simple maze game where the player is the bunny trying to find the carrot. I want to create a fun, visually cute game to enjoy.	


## Features
- Feature 1
    - a maze that can be explored with a finished line that results in a winning title card
- Feature 2
    - graphics with the character movements, a background, and a carrot that represents the finish line
- Feature N
    - using the random function to create multiple possible routes


## Challenges
- I will need to learn how to use key inputs so that the player can move around.
- I need to be able to create a border in the game where the player can't go.
- applying images onto surfaces as well as making animations for the bunny character to look like it moves


## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be to have the maze game work as well as have all the features that I want; the carrot having three
- possible locations, have the image of the bunny moving depending on the input, and a win title card


Minimal Viable Outcome:
-  The minimal outcome would be to have a maze game that works as well as have at least one location for the carrot and a title
-  card


## Milestones


- Week 1
  1. Create the basic game loops needed
  2. Create the artwork and all the surfaces needed


- Week 2
  1. Create the border of the maze
  2. game loops for specific events (showing the movements of the character and winning title when player reachs the carrot)


- Week N (Final)
  1. debugging, making sure everything works
  2. Creating the demo video and turning it in
